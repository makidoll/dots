# Maki's Dot Files

Here are guides and config files I've written and collected for Arch Linux

-   Main installation guide: [ARCH_INSTALL.md](ARCH_INSTALL.md)
-   Extras full of goodies: [ARCH_EXTRAS.md](ARCH_EXTRAS.md)
-   Extras for GNOME: [EXTRAS_GNOME.md](EXTRAS_GNOME.md)
-   Extras for audio: [EXTRAS_AUDIO.md](EXTRAS_AUDIO.md)
-   Extras for keyboard: [EXTRAS_KEYBOARD.md](EXTRAS_KEYBOARD.md)

Will eventually add an entire folder full of server configurations
